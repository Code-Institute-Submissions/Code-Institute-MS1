Welcome S-Lowes,

# MS1 Code Institute

I have decided to make a mock website for an imaginary climbing gym. Designed to be eye catching, responsive & accesible on different devices.

# User Experience

## User Stories

- First Time Visitor
    - When I visit this site I want to easily understand the purpose of the site and learn about the gym and it's specifications.
    - I would also like to be able to navigate through the site with ease and find the content I need such as the gyms location.
    - I may want to contact the gym to ask questions about courses/classes or about the gym in general.
- Returning Visitor
    - As a returning visitor I might be looking to signing up to the newsletter or find social links so I can keep up with events.
    - I may also be considering membership, so finding that page smoothly and seeing the membership sign up button easily would be ideal.
- Frequent User
    - As a frequent user I use the site to book courses especially 1 to 1 sessions.

## Design

- Color Scheme
    - Used a color called 'Sandstone" #786D5F since that was the theme. I also used an orange to accompany it and match some of the photos I managed to include. I finally used a white as I had used it in my logo.

- Typography
    - The Montserrat font is the main font used with Roboto as a secondary font. The fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly is sans-serif.

- Imagery
    - I think having images of people of people using the gym is a useful way to show the equipment available but also to make the website more appealing.

- Wireframes
    - I created Wireframes for various extra pages such as membership forms and an about us page. However these are extra pages and are not core to the websites design.
