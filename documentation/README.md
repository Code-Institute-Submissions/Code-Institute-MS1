Welcome S-Lowes,

# MS1 Code Institute

I have decided to make a mock website for an imaginary climbing gym. Designed to be eye catching, responsive & accesible on different devices.

# User Experience

## User Stories

- First Time Visitor
    - I want a first visitor to to easily understand the purpose of the site and learn about the gym and it's specifications.
    - Tgey should also to be able to navigate through the site with ease and find the content they need. <- Including Social Media
- Returning Visitor
    - A returning visitor may want to learn more about the gym by signing up to the email newsletter or find social links if they didn't follow the first time.
    - I would also want a returning visitor to be considering membership, so finding that page smoothly and seeing the membership sign up button easily would be ideal.
    - They may also want to find the contact us button so any questions about the gym can be answered.
- Frequent User
    - I can't image someone frequently using this website. But if they were going to it may be for booking courses especially 1 to 1 sessions.
    - They may also be looking for its location which is easily accesible from the home page.

## Design

- Color Scheme
    - Used a color called 'Sandstone" #786D5F since that was the theme. I also used an orange to accompany it and match some of the photos I managed to include. I finally used a white as I had used it in my logo.

- Typography
    - The Montserrat font is the main font used with Roboto as a secondary font. The fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly is sans-serif.

- Imagery
    - I think having images of people of people using the gym is a useful way to show the equipment available but also to make the website more appealing.

- Wireframes
    - I created Wireframes for various extra pages such as membership forms and an about us page. However these are extra pages and are not core to the websites design.
